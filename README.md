# Project Euler Code Repository
This is my attempt at completing the problems as layed out in Project Euler.
For details of the project [see here](https://projecteuler.net/)

The code is all written in Java. 

The code can be imported in eclipse and should compile as long as you have the JAVA environment set up correctly.
You will notice only one source file. Each problem has been encapsulated in a method, with certain helper methods that are used across different problems. The **main** function needs to be updated to call each problem as required.

**I have not worked on this in a while - I leave it here for reference**
