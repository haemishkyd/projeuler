# Project Euler Code Repository
This is my attempt at completing the problems as layed out in Project Euler.
For details of the project [see here](https://projecteuler.net/)

The code is all written in Java. 

The code can be imported in eclipse and should compile as long as you have the JAVA environment set up correctly.

**I have not worked on this in a while - I leave it here for reference**
